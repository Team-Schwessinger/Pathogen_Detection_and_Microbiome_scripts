# Pathogen_Detection_and_Microbiome_scripts
This repository is used for depositing the scripts and explainations supplimentary to Hu et al. 'Pathogen Detection and Microbiome Analysis of Infected Wheat Using a Portable DNA Sequencer' paper.

Here are brief descriptions for each script:


QC_and_BLAST.py: combined all the programes used in the analysis and save ouput files from each step into the desired place.
creating_final_dataframe.py: re-organizing all the output files of basecalling and each BLAST step, summarizing all the relavant information for data visualization.
